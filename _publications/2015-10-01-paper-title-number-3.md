excerpt: 'Cancer immunotherapies show promise in eliminating tumors, but identifying tumor peptides that bind patient MHC proteins to trigger immune responses remains challenging. The vast peptide-MHC diversity makes experimental identification costly, emphasizing the need for computational predictions.

To address scalability, we introduce SwiftMHC, an attention network for identifying MHC-bound peptides and generating all-atom 3D structures simultaneously. SwiftMHC processes cases in 0.01 to 2.2 seconds on a single A100 GPU, overcoming the speed bottleneck of structure-based approaches. It rivals or surpasses state-of-the-art tools, including an AlphaFold-based approach, in binding affinity prediction and 3D modeling.

SwiftMHC showcases the advantages of task-specific AI trained on physics-derived synthetic data for speed and precision. Optimized for HLA-A*0201 9-mers, it can be adapted to other MHC alleles. Its speed and accuracy may enable the community to identify peptides distinct from self-peptides at T-cell exposed surfaces, ensuring safer therapies, expanding immunotherapy targets, and accelerating development.
