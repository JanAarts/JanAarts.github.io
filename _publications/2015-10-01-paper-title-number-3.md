excerpt: >
  In animal ecosystems, energy expenditure plays a pivotal role in animals’ survival success, reproduction, and population dynamics. Throughout an animal's daily life, the total energy expenditure undergoes dynamic changes influenced by numerous internal and external factors.

  Indirect calorimetry in a climate respiration chamber (CRC) is the gold standard for measuring energy expenditure, yet its application is constrained. Placing animals in the CRC may induce stress, impacting metabolic rates, and the artificial chamber environment raises concerns about ecological validity.

  This article introduces an innovative non-invasive software sensor for online monitoring of dynamic energy expenditure. The system combines a wearable integrated sensor with an adaptive subject-specific model to estimate time-varying energy expenditure.

  The system is validated using four pigs of different ages and benchmarked against indirect calorimetric measurements under varying temperature and activity conditions.
