I am a PhD Candidate working in the Adaptation Physiology Group at Wageningen University & Research. I have a passion for algorithm design and machine learning and I am currently developing time-series classification models to personalize dairy cow lactation lenght. My research focusses on data-driven analyses of animal behavior, physiology, and welfare. My work combines computational methods, sensor technologies, and statistical modeling to better understand animal performance and support decision-making in research and industry.

I am also actively involved in teaching and student supervision, contributing to courses such as *Understanding and Using Sensor Data in Animal Sciences*, *Adaptation Physiology*, and guiding student internships as well as supervising BSc and MSc students with their thesis. Through these activities, I aim to bridge theory and practice, fostering the next generation of researchers in animal sciences.
